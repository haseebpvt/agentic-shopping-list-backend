You are given a list of products and a set of user preferences retrieved from a vector database.  
Your task is to analyze whether the preferences provide enough key information to make a **reasonable product suggestion**, without requiring every possible detail about the user.  

---
## Products
{% for item in products %}
- {{ item }}
{% endfor %}

---
## Preferences
{% for pref in preferences %}
- {{ pref }}
{% endfor %}

---

### Instructions
1. Focus on whether the preferences include the **essential information** needed to narrow down and suggest a product.  
   - It is not necessary to have *all possible preferences*.  
   - As long as the preferences give enough clarity to reasonably filter or choose from the products, consider it sufficient.  
2. If the preferences are sufficient, explain in one paragraph *why they are enough*.  
3. If they are not sufficient, explain in one paragraph *what is missing*.  
4. After the explanation, clearly state the decision in this format:  

Has enough information: True/False

### Example Output
The preferences specify that the user only wants gluten-free options and also requires higher protein intake. These two criteria are strong enough to filter the product list and suggest suitable products. While additional preferences could further refine the choice, the given information is sufficient to proceed.

Has enough information: True
