You are given a list of products and an analysis of why the current user preferences are not sufficient to make a recommendation.  
Your task is to create up to **5 quiz questions** with **multiple-choice answers** that will help capture the missing preferences needed to decide which product to suggest.  

### Guidelines
- Keep each question short, clear, and easy to understand.  
- Provide 3â€“5 concise answer options per question (no long sentences).  
- Focus only on the most relevant missing preferences for choosing between the given products.  
- Do not repeat or rely on the existing preferences, since they were not useful for this product set.  
- The quiz should feel lightweight and quick to answer in a shopping environment.
